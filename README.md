## Project Overview

This repository offers an **automated solution** specifically crafted for the MegaETH network. MegaETH is a Layer 2 blockchain solution designed to enhance the scalability of Ethereum by enabling real-time transaction processing. Our script targets the MegaETH Faucet, facilitating **fast and reliable token distribution** through automated processes that handle Turnstile captchas, proxy configurations, and multi-threaded wallet claims. 

## Features

- **Automated Turnstile Captcha Solving:** Seamlessly integrates with [2Captcha](https://2captcha.com/) to solve captchas automatically.
- **Proxy Support:** Compatible with both non-authenticated (`ip:port`) and authenticated proxies (`ip:port:user:pass`).
- **Multi-threaded Processing:** Handles wallet claims concurrently to maximize efficiency and throughput.
- **Flexible Wallet Configuration:** Supports wallet addresses from both `wallet.txt` (plain text) and `wallets.json` (JSON format).
- **Enhanced Logging:** Captures detailed logs with successes in `success.txt` and failures in `fail.txt`.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub to start using the automation tool:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aero25x/megaeth-faucet.git
cd megaeth-faucet
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies with pip:

```bash
pip install requests colorama twocaptcha pytz tzlocal
pip install 2captcha-python==1.5.1
```

*Note: Verify package versions and update if necessary.*

## Configuration

Before running the script, update the configurations to match your environment and MegaETH network settings.

### Wallet Configuration

#### `wallet.txt`

Add your MegaETH wallet addressesâ€”one per line:

```text
0xYourWalletAddress1
0xYourWalletAddress2
```

#### `wallets.json` (Optional)

Load additional wallet addresses using JSON format:

```json
[
    {"address": "0xYourWalletAddress3"},
    {"address": "0xYourWalletAddress4"}
]
```

Wallet addresses from `wallets.json` are combined with those in `wallet.txt`.

### Proxy Configuration

#### `proxy.txt`

List your proxies in one of the following formats:

- **Without Authentication:**

  ```text
  192.168.1.100:8080
  ```

- **With Authentication:**

  ```text
  31.56.139.207:6276:hxjsvept:3pzgwox5suvu
  ```

### Script Settings

Edit the script (e.g., `main.py`) and update your API keys along with MegaETH configuration details:

```python
TWO_CAPTCHA_API_KEY = "Your_2Captcha_API_Key"
TURNSTILE_SITEKEY = "Your_Turnstile_Sitekey"
TURNSTILE_PAGE_URL = "https://testnet.megaeth.com/"
```

You can further adjust thread counts, endpoints, and other settings as needed.

## Usage

Execute the script to initiate the token claim process on the MegaETH Faucet:

```bash
python faucet.py
```

### Example Output

```
Processing wallet: 0xYourWalletAddress1
Attempt 1: Using proxy IP 31.56.139.207
Requesting Turnstile captcha solution from 2Captcha...
Turnstile captcha solved successfully.
Claim response: https://www.megaexplorer.xyz/tx/transaction_hash_here
Claim SUCCESS for wallet 0xYourWalletAddress1
```

## Logging

- **Successful Claims:** All successful transactions are recorded in `success.txt`.
- **Failed Attempts:** Any errors or failed transactions are recorded in `fail.txt`.
